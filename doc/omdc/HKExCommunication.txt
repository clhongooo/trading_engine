Re       :      Configuration Setting for connection to OCG End-to-End Testing Environment

Following your submission of “Information Sheet for Application of Testing Line” to HKEx, enclosed please find your firm’s configuration settings for connection to OCG End-to-End (E2E) Testing environment. Please follow the configuration settings to make connection to the OCG E2E Testing environment upon the readiness of your BSS testing circuit.  Kindly be reminded that the OCG E2E Testing for Batch 1 users is scheduled from 9 December 2013 to 28 February 2014.  

Should you require a change to the pre-assigned configuration setting, please complete and submit the attached “OCG End-to-End Testing Session Configuration Change Form” to us on or before 2 December 2013 by email to bsssupport@hkex.com.hk and follow by telephone call at 2840-3351 to confirm submission.  Please note that submission after the abovementioned deadline to change the configuration setting would not be effective before the start of OCG E2E Testing.

The configuration setting for connection to OMD-C in OCG E2E testing environment will be shortly issued to EP or BSS vendor who requires the connection under separate cover.
