Hi Grace,

If your team needs to set up a new VPN connection, please complete the Schedule 2 here: http://www.cmegroup.com/globex/files/CMEGlobexSch2AccessRequest.pdf
Upon receiving the complete paperwork, our Network Engineer will contact you around 3 – 5 U.S. business days to provide the VPN connection details.

For the certification environment setup, please follow the similar instruction in my original email below to (1) send me the CME Group Login of the tester and; (2) application system details. As discussed, if this is a new system, perhaps it’s easier to come up with a new application name instead of simply changing the version. And the new system must be certified before rolling out to production. 

Free feel to reach out for further questions.
